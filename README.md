 Shiny application to examine the resultant data from a simulated clinical trial.
 
 The following Shiny application is built to examine the resultant data from a simulated clinical trial in which there were three treatment arms: Drug X, Combination, and Placebo.  Patient demographics and two biomarkers were recorded at the start of the trial (or at screening).  A patient's laboratory measurements for ALT, CRP, IGA were recorded during screening, baseline, and 4 additional times each one week apart ollowing baseline.  
 
 The resultant application will help with examining covariate balance across the treatment arms during screening.  This is achieved using density/stacked-barplots across the treatment arms as well as summary tables.
 
 In the second tab graphs and tables are provided to see the overall change across the trial.  This can be done either looking at a specific treatment arm and seeing how the laboratory measurements evolve alongside each other or between treatment arms looking at how the change in measurements varies across groups.
